## Assignments

### Assignment1
Goals：In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
- Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier.
- Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
- Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.

Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier

Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine

Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier
